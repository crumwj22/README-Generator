# Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Contributing

Please read the installation section. For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute. For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues. For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.
